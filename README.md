# filmSetPhotoPortfolio

My intention for this assignment is to use bootstrap to create an photography portfolio site. It will feature photos that I took on set during the making of two independent feature films made by my friend Edward Davee. 

The site will include an home page featuring of carousel of images, and some text about my experience as a set photographer. There will be a menu bar with links to two pages displaying photos from each film. Iâ€™m hoping to include 8 - 10 photos on each page, and a brief description of each film, and my experience in shooting each.
